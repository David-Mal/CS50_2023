If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Provided that the top 100 mostly consists of sad and happy songs the listener's aura might be in between those 2 main feelings.
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Because the top 100 I was provided with might not suit every person's preferences. A better method to calculate a listener's aura would be to look at his/her top 100 favorite songs.
