        <h4>Computer Science:</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 120%;">This passion started 3 years ago when I got into highschool. I started with competitive programming, trying to solve as many problems as I could.
            I competed against one of my classmates during one summer, each of us trying to overpass the other in the amount of CP problems solved. After some time
            I decided to look into other fields of computer science, my main goal being to create my own sites. Apart from that I also began to learn <code>C#</code> and I built simple games
            like <em>Tic-Tac-Toe</em> or <em>The Hangman</em>. Now I'm looking forward to continuing to learn more about Web Development and building more advanced stuff.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Music:</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 120%;">
            My passion for music started 4 years ago when I learned to play the guitar and I fell in love with the instrument.
            After some time I also decided to buy a trumpet and I'm now learning how to play it, and so far I find it more difficult than the guitar.
            Apart from playing music I love listening to it, and I'm interested in finding artist and their creations. I love multiple genres of music but
            the one I listen to the most is hip-hop.
        </p>
        <h4>Football:</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 120%;">
            I love football since childhood. I didn't always love it, as I was pretty bad at it when I was a kid, and during school
            PE classes I was usually benched. But I kept playing it and became good enough. I am now playing this sport once or twice a week
            and every time I get a chance to play a match I am on it.
        </p>
        <h4>Cycling:</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 120%;">
            This one I don't practice that much, and I think that riding my bicyle became a passion just because I had to get used to it
            as it's my main method of traveling in town and I go to school by my bike almost everyday. But I barely refuse a chance to ride my
            bike with some friends, and upon that I really fancy long rides through wich I am able to enjoy the nature.
